# IncomeInequality

Welcome to my project repository! Here, you'll find all the materials and results related to my in-depth data analysis and visualization project.

## Navigation and Viewing Options

### 1. **[`View_Full_Project.md`](https://github.com/AyushmaanGandhi/IncomeInequality/blob/main/View_Full_Project.md)**
  - This markdown file provides a link to view the fully rendered and interactive version of the notebook using Nbviewer.
      - **The link is provided again [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/AyushmaanGandhi/IncomeInequality/blob/main/Notebook_No_Visualization.ipynb) for your convenience.**
  - Nbviewer provides enhanced viewing capabilities, ensuring **all** visualizations, particularly those created with Altair, are rendered and interactive.
  - This version is ideal for those who wish to explore the complete and interactive project directly in their web browser without needing to run the code.

### 2. **[`Notebook_No_Visualization.ipynb`](https://github.com/AyushmaanGandhi/IncomeInequality/blob/main/Notebook_No_Visualization.ipynb)**
  - This version is ideal for those who'd like to download the notebook and run it on their local machine or through their own Jupyter server.
  - **Note**: Due to GitHub's limited rendering capabilities for Jupyter Notebooks, most interactive visualizations are **not** displayed properly when viewing the notebook directly on GitHub, which is why it is recommended to view the version above instead.

## How to Navigate
- Click on the filenames above to explore the respective versions.
- If you choose the `.md` option and wish to see the interactive visualizations, click on the provided link in the `View_Full_Project.md` file to view the notebook in Nbviewer.
- If you choose the `.ipynb` option and wish to interact with the code, download the notebook and run it using a Jupyter Notebook server.

Thank you for exploring my project, and feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback!

Best,

Ayushmaan Gandhi
